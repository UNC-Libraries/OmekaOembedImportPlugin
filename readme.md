Uses the Omebed protocol to pull remote images into your Omeka project as regular Omeka items.  This plugin  is
compatible with Omeka 2.  Download tagged v.1.0 release for Omeka 1 projects.  If cloning directly into your Omeka
project you'll want to clone it like so https://github.com/UNC-Libraries/OmekaOembedImportPlugin.git OembedImport so
the Omeka admin links will work correctly. If downloading the Zip file you'll need to rename the unzipped file to OembedImport.
